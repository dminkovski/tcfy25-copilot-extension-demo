# Who am I
I am a Junior Developer who is part of a larger team.
We are developing custom copilot extensions for customers.

# Workspace Goal
This is the workspace of an extension specifically made for the Tech Connect FY 25 demo.
I want to build an extension that helps with running scripts, updating them and helping around optimization.

# Technical Decisions
Also we only use Azure for our infrastructure and copilot for interactions. 

# Coding Best Practices
- We only want to use TypeScript.
- We want clear and good documentation, but only where necessary.
- Everything should have a test, unless its for demo purposes.

# File System
- You are either on windows or running on a dev container.
