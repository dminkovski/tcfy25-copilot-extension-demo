# WRK731 - Supercharge Developer Workflow with GitHub Copilot Workspace Extension Demo
> Tech Connect FY 25 - Workshop | February 11, 2025 | 04:00 PM PST

This repository holds the demo code on how to build a VS Code extension for GitHub Copilot with context optimization, supervised automation, advanced reasoning, and goal seeking. Participants of this workshop should already be users of VS Code and GH Copilot, and they should have a good foundational experience in software development.

## Overview
The project consists of two parts.
1. In the `src` folder exists a very simple and basic node & express server, as well as an openapi.yaml spec.
2. This simple app is used to demonstrate the chat participants abilities. 
3. To run the app server, use `npm install` in the root folder and `npm start` to launch the web server. 

## Getting Started

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.
2. In the extension root folder under `.vscode\extensions\rest-api-copilot`, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run compile
   ```
3. The compiled files will be placed in the `out` directory.

## Installation

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` in Visual Studio Code to open the Command Palette.
2. Type and Select **>Developer: Install Extension from Location...**.
3. Browse to and select the folder `.vscode\extensions\rest-api-copilot`.

## Usage

1. Open Copilot in Visual Studio Code (`Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Mention **@rest** in the beginning of your request.
3. When you need to build a new API endpoint or test the OpenAPI spec,  (e.g., "@rest, please help me create a new endpoint.").
4. The chat participant will ask you for manual validation  to create files or run scripts. It will however only need a positive response to update files.
5. For ongoing collaboration, continue addressing **@rest** with additional questions or requests about building and testing Node.js API endpoints.

> Warning: This is a PoC and Demo that allows Copilot to update and create files as well as run scripts directly on your machine or inside a dev container.
