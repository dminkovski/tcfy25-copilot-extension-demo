Prompting @Wilot (Workspacecopilot Extension)

Scenario: Create a node web server

1. Initial Prompt to Wilot:
"@wilot **Behaviour:**
Do not stop and use any tooling necessary to reach main goal.
You only work and run commands in the folder "C:\Users\dminkovski\Development\Microsoft\TechConnect\VSCode\" or the subfolders - you will create a folder called "src".
**Main goal:**
Create a simple REST API Node server. It should print "Hello Tech Connect" on request.
**Priorities:**
Use best practices for node js projects
**Important:**
Create a log.md file in src.
Update log.md whenever you do something by running a command.
Format needs to be Markdown only.
Log any error and solution you encounter. 
**Commands:**
All commands are to be run in the src folder.
Example: "cd C:\Users\dminkovski\Development\Microsoft\TechConnect\VSCode\src && npm install"
**Goal achieved check:**
Server is running
Command is running too long = timeout"

Expect: server running at localhost.

Notes: Beware filepath in tools-prompt.tsx that is needed to run.

In DevContainer - file manipulation is still tricky -> needs to be adjusted an tested.

2. Prompt to Wilot:
"@wilot Stop the server and adjust the api to take a query parameter as name to respond with Hello and the name of the user. Restart the server so the changes can take effect."
